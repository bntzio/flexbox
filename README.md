What The FlexBox?!
------------------

[What The FlexBox?!](http://flexbox.io) is a simple, free 20 video course that will help you master CSS Flexbox.

A quick video course created by [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) :)

This repo is my follow-through of the course, which I'll be using as a reference later if I need to do so.

The commits and comments are clean and organized 8)

I learned a lot, thank you [@wesbos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) ^^
